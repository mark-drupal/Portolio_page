Personal Portfolio Webpage

This project is a part of the course for completing the www.freecodecamp.com Responsive Webdesign project.  I am uploading this 
to my github account to allow for practice of using Git.  To see what has to be created look at the spec which can be found here:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage

An example page can be found here:

Initially my aim was to create a bare bones page which passes the javascript tests.  I then plan to improve on this (the inital page 
does not look very pretty).
